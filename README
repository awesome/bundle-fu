bundle_fu
---------

Each css / js you load causes your site to load slower!  You can speed things up 
exponentially by simply combining all your css/js files into one file each.  

Bundle_fu makes it easy to do.  It's as easy as 1, 2!

Step 1:
Install this plugin

Step 2:
Put the following around your stylesheets/javascripts (note it works with any method of including assets!):

  <% bundle do %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "prototype" %>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "basic.css" %>
    <%= calendar_date_select_includes params[:style] %>
    <script src="javascripts/application.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <% end %>

That's it!

Gotchas:
  * All content inside of bundle do will be replaced with a single js and css include statement.  Any other content will be lost.  Be sure to only put css / js includes inside of the block.
  * Scripts / stylesheets are detected by parseing the output and looking for include files.  Comments are ignored, so if you comment out a stylesheet like this: 
		  <% bundle do %>
		    <%= javascript_include_tag "prototype" %>
		    <!-- <%= stylesheet_link_tag "basic.css" %> -->
		    <%= calendar_date_select_includes params[:style] %>
		    <script src="javascripts/application.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		  <% end %>
    
    The comment will be ignored and the css file will be bundled anyways.  If you need to comment out a css file to perform an ie6 hack, put it outside the bundle block. 
		  <% bundle do %>
		    <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
		    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "basic.css" %>
		  <% end %>
    	
    
    (it shouldn't be bundled anyways, since it's conditionally loaded)
